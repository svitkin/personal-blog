I am a freelance software engineer with a background in data science. This site is built with <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio" target="_blank">Hugo</a> and <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/" target="_blank">blogdown</a>, two great tools for easily building static websites. This site uses the accessibility-friendly Hugo theme <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/cupper-hugo-theme/" target="_blank">Cupper</a>.
